# LOTR Kings Addon
## Description
This is a mod developed for me and my friends to use. While some features are made for general use, 
by and large the expectation was for use by my friends and I on our own server.

## Modules
This mod is broken up into modules that can be turned on and off at will via config.

1. Crafting Recipe Module
    
    The crafting module is primarily used to add recipes for items that are normally unobtainable in middle earth.
    In particular, it adds crafting recipes for the following:
    * Enchanted books
    * Quartz
    * Beacons
    * Redstone
    * Stone chests
   
    These recipes can be turned on or off individually via config.
2. More Money Module
    
    The more money module adds 1 crafting recipe along with adding 3 larger denominations beyond the 100 Coin.
3. Per Player Mob Cap Module
   
    Revamps the mob-spawning algorithm to work on individual players. This is changed in both middle-earth and utumno and
    can be configured to a small degree within the config.

4. Lore Weapons Module

    Work in progress module that adds custom weapons and armor. Currently adds 2 weapons, both of which are only 
    obtainable in creative.
5. Custom Default Waypoints:

## Wish List
1. Custom Weapons ( still working on this, need more people to donate textures )
2. Add to the Default WP list -- ALMOST DONE!

4. Add a hard level cap to Unit leveling.
5. Add a "tilemap" layer to the in-game map that shows current conquest ( per discord ).
6. Implement progression in-game so you can't perform un-allowed actions.
8. Add population tracking in-game, that blocks you from hiring units if you don't have the pop.
8. Rings of Power?
9. Custom Siege Machines
10. Make Waypoint usage dynamic so conquered territories can switch what faction they are attached to.
11. Remove Cooldown from reforging
